        <p class="bio-text">In Noxus, any citizen may rise to power regardless of race, gender, or social standing - strgnth is all that matters. I should early potential as a soldier, forcing myself to master the weight of a long sword when I was barely its height. I was ruthless and efficient as a warrier, but my true strength lay in my conviction. I entered battles without any trace of doubt in my mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. So exceptional was my passion that the High Command recognized me with a black stone rune stone. Soon after I was deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion. What started as a war became an extermination. Ionian society would not be reformed, merely eliminated. During one bitter engagement, my unit was surrounded by Ionian forces. We called for support as the enemy closed in. What we received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by Singed. I watched as Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to a gruesome fate. I managed to escape, but could not erase the memory. Counted as dead by Noxus, I saw an opportunity to start anew. I shattered my sword, severing ties with the past, and wandered in self-imposed exile - on a quest to seek atonement and a way to save the pure Noxian vision in which I believed.</p>
